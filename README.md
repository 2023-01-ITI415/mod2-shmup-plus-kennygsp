# Ch3031SpaceShmup
For my version of SpaceShmup I decided to add a few minor features such as:
Waves - After reaching a certain score the wave will change and new enemies will spawn in
Score and Highscore - The players current score is displayed along with the high score
Sounds - Player has a blaster sound - Enemies have distinct grunts - Added background music
